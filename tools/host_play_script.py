Scripts (headless runs with the oracle's firmware image and a fresh save file unless said otherwise):
  play      the oracle's play script: the touch on the title, A every second from frame 2400.
  town      a new game through the intro (the name entries: a touch on the keyboard's Confirm button every
            600 frames and Start every second confirm a name), the town hall's tutorial, out into town.
  save      town, then the walk to the player's house, into the house and out, Tom Nook's talk about the loan,
            Start -> "Save and end": the first save (written to ACWW_SAVE) and back to the title.
  continue  with the save file from `save`: the title's continue path, the player wakes up in the house and
            stands in front of it in town.
  gate-host, gate-visit
            local wireless between two copies (tools/host_wireless_test.sh), each with the save file from `save` and
            ACWW_TEST_JOB_DONE=1 (the gate opens only after Nook's part-time job): continue, walk to the gate house,
            in, talk to Copper. gate-host opens the gate ("Invite guests!", DS to DS) and walks off; gate-visit goes
            out (DS to DS), picks the town found, travels, arrives at the host's gate, goes back in and asks Copper to
            go home. Real time from frame 9600 on (ACWW_FAST=9600): the copies wait for each other.
Frame numbers are virtual frames (ACWW_KEYS / ACWW_TOUCH: frame:frames:value); keys are KEYINPUT bits (hex).
