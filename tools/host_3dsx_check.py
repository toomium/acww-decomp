"""Checks a .3dsx's relocations (the 3DS build, docs/3ds.md): every relocated word must name a place in the program.

The format keeps a relocation's target as an offset into the program, with the top 4 bits a sub-type (absolute: 0;
relative: 0 = 32-bit, 1 = 31-bit), so it can't express an address outside the program - such as the constant
`array - 0x04000000` the compiler folds `array + (addr - 0x04000000)` into. The loaders refuse such a program (Azahar:
"A generic load error"). Exit status 1, with the words listed, if there are any.
