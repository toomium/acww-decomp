// Host build runtime: the operating-system services the runtime needs (docs/portability.md 1.4, 4.2). One
// implementation per platform: plat_posix.c (Linux, macOS), plat_win32.c (Windows); the parts that are plain C
// are in plat_common.c. Nothing else in modern/host calls the operating system directly, except the POSIX-only
// debugging aids (debug_posix.c, guards.c), the i386 viewer link (frontend_viewer.c), the low-4 GB harness
// (hw.c, ACWW_HIGHMEM: x86-64 Linux only) and the wireless's UDP sockets (wm7.c, POSIX and Winsock).
