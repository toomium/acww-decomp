// The project's own renderer for the DS's two 2D display engines (docs/portability.md 5.1). Plain C, no host or
// emulator dependencies: it is given the display registers as they are written, and at each frame the VRAM banks,
// the palettes, OAM and the 3D engine's output, and renders both screens.
//
// Written from the hardware's documented behaviour (GBATEK, "DS Video"): BG modes 0-6 (text BGs in 16 and 256
// colours with extended palettes, affine BGs, extended affine BGs with 16-bit map entries and 256-colour and
// direct-colour bitmaps, the large bitmap of mode 6), the 3D layer as BG0 of engine A, OBJs (normal, affine,
// double size, 1D and 2D mapping of tiles and bitmaps, extended OBJ palettes, semi-transparent OBJs, the OBJ window),
// the windows, colour special effects (alpha blending, brightness up and down), mosaic, the display modes (off,
// normal, VRAM display; main memory display is reported, not shown) and master brightness. Display capture is not
// implemented (the game doesn't use it: a capture request is reported once).
//
// The registers are kept per engine as the 0x70 bytes from 0x04000000 (engine A) and 0x04001000 (engine B), plus
// POWCNT1 (0x04000304) and VRAMCNT (0x04000240-0x04000249); other addresses are ignored. The frame is rendered line
// by line, with an H-blank callback between lines (Gpu2dFrameInput.hblank) for the game's per-line effects.
